# How Do
1. Unzip folder
2. Run "PCMaster.exe"
3. Connect your BMS via UART adapter cable
4. Click "commset" in the upper write hand corner and set the Port to the port the UART adapter is plugged into (this can be found in Device Manager)
# Tips, tricks, notes
- Sometimes It'll just crash when the BMS wakes up, or when a load is connected.
